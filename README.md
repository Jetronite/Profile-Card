## 🪪 Profile Card Component

A responsive and interactive **Profile Card** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
This card displays a user’s name, bio, avatar, social links, hobbies, dislikes, and the current time (updated in milliseconds).

### 📸 **Preview**

A modern, clean design optimized for all screen sizes.
On desktop, the layout switches to a **grid structure**, while on mobile it remains **flexible and stacked**.

---

### 🚀 **Features**

* Responsive layout using **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid**
* Dynamic timestamp updated with **JavaScript (`Date.now()`)**
* Clean, modern UI with hover effects
* Organized sections for:

  * **User bio**
  * **Social links**
  * **Hobbies**
  * **Dislikes**
  * **Action buttons** (`Follow`, `Message`)

---

### 🧱 **Tech Stack**

* **HTML5** — semantic structure
* **CSS3** — responsive design using media queries
* **Vanilla JavaScript** — real-time time update feature

├── index.html      # Main HTML file

└── README.md       # Project documentation
```

### ⚙️ **How It Works**

1. When the page loads, JavaScript captures the `<p data-testid="test-user-time">` element.
2. It sets its content to the current time in milliseconds using `Date.now()`.
3. The time auto-updates every second with `setInterval()`.
4. The CSS adjusts the layout responsively at:

   * `max-width: 480px` (mobile)
   * `min-width: 1024px` (desktop grid layout)

---

### 🧪 **Test IDs**

This project includes `data-testid` attributes for automated testing (e.g., HNG internship tasks).
Example:

```html
<p data-testid="test-user-time"></p>
```

---

### 📋 **How to Run**

1. Clone or download the project folder.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Observe the real-time timestamp and responsive layout in action.
